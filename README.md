This project is written in python and is powered by simPy, numpy, and matplotlib. You may use Anaconda for package management and installing
the mentioned libraries. Alternatively, you can install them by following the instructions on their respective websites:

The project consists of three Python files. The main file to be executed by the user is 'project.py,' which serves as our main file. The other 
files contain methods for message handling and visualization. While every single method has been explained using comments, feel free to contact
